# UW FinTech BootCamp Module 20 Challenge - Smart Contract Joint Savings Account

---

## Description
A fintech startup company has recently hired you. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, 
Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate 
many of the institutionsâ€™ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. 
The steps for this project are divided into the following sections:

* Using Solidity, create a smart contract that serves as a Joint Savings Account between two Ethereum Addresses.
  * It should function so that users are able to deposit, withdraw, set each account address, and validate that the correct addresses are used when calling the contract functions.
* Compile and Deploy Your Contract using the Remix VM. 
* Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract.
  * Test the deposit functionality of your smart contract by making 3 seperate deposits. Take screenshots of each transaction.
  * Test the withdrawal functionality of your smart contract by making 2 separate withdrawals. Take screenshots of each transaction.

## Summary
Using [Remix](https://remix-project.org/), the smart contract can be compiled into an Ethereum VM (Remix VM in this case). After all the required functions are coded and the contract is successfully compiled and deployed -- it should look like this:

Using the `deposit` function in Remix will fund the joint savings account.
To test our deposit function, we will make 3 separate deposits and use the `contractBalance` function after each transaction to verify that the funds were added to your contract.
  * Transaction 1: Deposit 1 Ether as Wei.
  
  ![Deposit one](https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings/blob/main/Execution_Results/Transaction%201.png)
  
  * Transaction 2: Deposit 10 Ether as Wei.
  
  ![Deposit two](https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings/blob/main/Execution_Results/Transaction%202.png)
  
  * Transaction 3: Deposit 5 Ether.
  
  ![Deposit three](https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings/blob/main/Execution_Results/Transaction%203.png)
  
 With 16 ETH now deposited into the joint savings account, we can now test the `withdraw` function.
 To do so, we will make 2 separate withdrawals into each account. 
 (Note: the user is able to use the `lastToWithdraw` and `lastWithdrawAmount` functions to verify that the address and amounts were correct.)
  * Transaction 4:  Withdraw 5 Ether as Wei to account1.
  
  ![Withdrawal one](https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings/blob/main/Execution_Results/Withdraw%205%20Eth.png)
  
  * Transaction 5: Withdraw 10 Ether as Wei to account2.

  ![Withdrawal two](https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings/blob/main/Execution_Results/Withdraw%2010%20Eth.png)
  
 _As we can see from the examples above, the functionality of our smart contract joint savings account is successful!_

## Technologies

This application was written in Python 3.7 using the following dependencies:
1. [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) (^0.5.0) - Smart contract development
2. [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/) - Solidity development environment

---

## Installation and Usage
* If you would like to use this contract yourself, clone the repository on your local machine by typing `git clone https://github.com/asabeti/Module_20_Smart_Contract_Joint_Savings.git`
* Select the "0.5.0+commit.1d4f565a" compiler to compile the smart contract in the "Remix VM (London or Berlin)" to deploy the contract in your environment.
