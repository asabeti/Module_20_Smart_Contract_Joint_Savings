# UW FinTech BootCamp Module 20 Challenge - Smart Contract Joint Savings Account

---

## Description
A fintech startup company has recently hired you. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, 
Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate 
many of the institutionsâ€™ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts. 
The steps for this project are divided into the following sections:

* Using Solidity, create a smart contract that serves as a Joint Savings Account between two Ethereum Addresses.
  * It should function so that users are able to deposit, withdraw, set each account address, and validate that the correct addresses are used when calling the contract functions.
* Compile and Deploy Your Contract using the Remix VM. 
* Interact with Your Deployed Smart Contract.
  * Test the deposit functionality of your smart contract by making 3 seperate deposits. Take screenshots of each transaction.
  * Test the withdrawal functionality of your smart contract by making 2 separate withdrawals. Take screenshots of each transaction.
